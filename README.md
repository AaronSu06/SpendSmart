# SpendSmart
SpendSmart is a Java application designed to help high-school and post-secondary students budget their finances by tracking their income and expenses. Additionally, the application
will provide a section to rate the users' knowledge on finance and give them resources based
on their results.

# Features:
- Real-time information updating, re-direct to resource origin on click, usage of JFreeChart
and Gson to properly save and display data, Algorithm to display resources corresponding
to the users responses in the survey, fully functional GUI

# Major Skills:
- Usage of Object-Oriented Programming, Loops, Hashmaps, Arrays / ArrayLists, APIs such as JFreeChart, Gson,
Date, Java Swing Components

# Areas of Concern:
- If the resource of origin is taken down by the host, the code may bug out. Additionally, the JFreeChart
I am using is an old version because the new one has removed the 3D bar graph. For this reason, the 
information on the axis may be low quality.
